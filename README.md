Hi, I’m [Your Name]. I work as a DevOps Engineer at HSBC, where I support teams with cloud infrastructure and automation. My main skills include configuring and managing cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Over the past few years, I’ve successfully completed multiple cloud migration projects, helping teams move their applications to the cloud smoothly.

I specialize in automating workflows to save time and reduce errors, using tools like Terraform, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. I also have DevSecOps experience—I’ve integrated security tools such as SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) scans into our pipelines to make systems safer.

I enjoy solving technical challenges and working with teams to build reliable, secure, and efficient systems. Let me know if you’d like to discuss cloud solutions or automation!
